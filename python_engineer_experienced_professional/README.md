# Code Execution 
- All of my code resides in the response directory, below is how all the python files work together
- The file_reader.py contains the main program that answers most of the questions
- The main.py file contains the seamless execution strategy for the entire project, and this can be achieved from the terminal with python src/response/main.py
- The test.py file contains the unit test configurations for all of my work on this project, and it's also executable from the command line.
